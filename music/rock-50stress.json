  "lyrics": "Confusion in her eyes that says it all\nShe's lost control\nAnd she's clinging to the nearest passerby\nShe's lost control\nAnd she gave away the secrets of her past\nAnd said, \"I've lost control again\"\nAnd to the voice that told her when and where to act\nShe said, \"I've lost control again\"\nAnd she turned around and took me by the hand\nAnd said, \"I've lost control again\"\nAnd how I'll never know just why or understand\nShe said, \"I've lost control again\"\nAnd she screamed out, kicking on her side, and said\n\"I've lost control again\"\nAnd seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die\nShe said, \"I've lost control\"\nShe's lost control again\nShe's lost control\nShe's lost control again\nShe's lost control\nThat I had to phone her friend to state my case\nAnd say she's lost control again\nAnd she showed up all the errors and mistakes\nAnd said, \"I've lost control again\"\nAnd she expressed herself in many different ways\nUntil she lost control again\nAnd walked upon the edge of no escape\nAnd laughed, \"I've lost control\"\nShe's lost control again\nShe's lost control\nShe's lost control again\nShe's lost control"
